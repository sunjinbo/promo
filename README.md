# promo
This program use a web spider to fetching tv promo data over the network, and after that I also will build a Restfull API service for client on Aliyun. so I divide this program into four parts:

Part 1. Implements a web spider to fecthing tv promo data and store them in database;

Part 2. Create a set of Restfull API to provide data service;

Part 3. Deploy the above service on Aliyun or somewhere else;

Part 4. Write a client, and accesses server-side data.
